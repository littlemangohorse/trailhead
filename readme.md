# Trailhead: Day Organizer

Trailhead is a concept app by me to tackle my worst problem: I can't organize myself. Chronic procrastinators, creatives who move at the speed of light, and cats all have the same problem: Things sneak up, and sometimes we get burnt out, with no intrinsic motivation. What do we do? Sleep. Trailhead I hope will be the solution.

## Overview

Trailhead is organized into a single view: The Living Room. Here I take inspiration from the apps Kyo and Joi, both gorgeously designed projects. At the bottom, the action panel with every conceivable setting and function you can do in the app. The top screen is a snapshot window of everything you need to do.

### Roadmap

Phase 1: Core Features

Develop the main UI components:

- Morning Greeting section with snapshot info.

- Sync tasks across Mac and iPhone.

Phase 2: Personality and Trails

Design and integrate "Trails" with unique animations and personalities.

- Add gamification features: rewards, progress tracking, and trail achievements.

- Implement drag-and-drop task management and scheduling ( Apple Calendar ).

- Develop playful notifications and visual interest.

Phase 3: Apple Ecosystem Integration

- Build the Mac companion app with advanced planning tools.
